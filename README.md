MERN Blog Application
Node.js React MongoDB Express.js JWT Google OAuth Firebase Swagger Axios Flowbite ESLint Nodemon Git

A full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This application allows users to create, update, delete, and manage blog posts and comments. It includes authentication (JWT and Google OAuth), a like/dislike feature, and an admin panel for managing content.

Backend Checklist
Set Up Models

 User Model: Contains fields like name, email, password, and any other necessary user info.

 Post Model: Should include fields like title, content, author (linked to User), and createdAt.

 Comment Model: Should include fields like content, postId (linked to Post), authorId (linked to User), and createdAt.

Set Up Routes

 Post Routes:

 Create a post (POST /api/posts)

 Get all posts (GET /api/posts)

 Get a specific post by ID (GET /api/posts/:id)

 Update a post (PUT /api/posts/:id)

 Delete a post (DELETE /api/posts/:id)

 Comment Routes:

 Add a comment (POST /api/comments)

 Get all comments for a post (GET /api/comments/:postId)

 Update a comment (PUT /api/comments/:id)

 Delete a comment (DELETE /api/comments/:id)

 Authentication Routes (for registration and login):

 Register (POST /api/auth/register)

 Login (POST /api/auth/login)

JWT Authentication

 JWT Token Generation: Ensure that on login, the server generates a token for the user.

 JWT Token Verification Middleware: Use a middleware function to verify the token on protected routes.

 User Authorization: Make sure users can only update or delete their own posts/comments.

Database Connection

 MongoDB Connection: Ensure you are using MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB database. The connection should be properly set up in db.js.

Environment Variables

 .env: Make sure sensitive information like your MongoDB URI and JWT secret are stored in .env.

 Production Config: If you’re deploying, ensure production environment variables (like MongoDB URI, JWT secret) are set in the hosting environment (e.g., Render).

Validation

 Input Validation: Add validation on user inputs (e.g., checking if email is valid, password strength, etc.). You can use libraries like express-validator or Joi.

Error Handling

 Custom Error Responses: Implement error handling in the routes to ensure the API returns useful error messages (e.g., 400 for bad request, 404 for not found).

 Error Handling Middleware: Use a centralized error handling middleware to catch unexpected errors.

Logging

 Logging: Implement logging for requests and responses using tools like morgan or a custom logger.

Testing the API Locally

 Postman: Before deployment, test all API routes using Postman.

 JWT Token Test: Test the authentication flow by registering, logging in, and using the token to access protected routes.

 CRUD Operations Test: Test creating, updating, and deleting posts and comments to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

Security

 Password Hashing: Ensure that passwords are hashed before being saved to the database (using bcryptjs).

 Sanitization: Sanitize user inputs to avoid security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

Rate Limiting (Optional)

 Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., too many login attempts). You can use libraries like express-rate-limit.
